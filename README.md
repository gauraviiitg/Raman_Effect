This repository contains an ongoing project aimed at predicting rainfall patterns across various regions in India using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The project leverages time series data to classify rainfall occurrences and predict rainfall amounts, providing a more accurate alternative to traditional models used by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD)
